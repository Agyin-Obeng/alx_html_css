Advanced HTML & CSS Project

Bringing structure and style together — from raw HTML to a visually stunning webpage.

- Overview

This repository showcases my implementation of the Advanced HTML & CSS project, focusing on transforming well-structured HTML into a fully designed webpage using modern CSS practices.

It builds on the foundational HTML (Advanced) concepts, emphasizing layout precision, typography, and responsive styling inspired by a Figma design file.

- Design Reference

The entire webpage is based on a Figma prototype, which guided every visual and structural decision — from spacing and color palettes to font pairing and alignment.
